## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer and software dev. I specialize in continuous delivery (specially in .NET environments) and observability.

My main *forte* is building DevSecOps end-to-end delivery "platforms" that guide the customer[^1] through the entire application
development process, from scaffolding new projects, through the first commit and successful CI run all the way to an automated
deployment to production.

### My Usual Stack

- Various versions of .NET, C#, F#, VB.NET, etc.
- Kubernetes
  - [Helm](https://helm.sh) and [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) for packaging / configuration management
  - [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) for Continuous Deployment
  - [Backstage](https://backstage.io) for better DevEx
  - [Grafana LGTM](https://grafana.com) stack for Observability
- Continuous Integration
  - CI Platforms
    - GitLab Pipelines
